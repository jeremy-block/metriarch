8/21/2023 - Tried adding data from the metrics tool. Beyond changing the data source, there are additional modifications to combined data file to make it work with code:

1. Rename Columns:
Filename -> session

2. Fill all empty cells with 0 value

3. Make column "section" for classifications (grouping/filtering in the chart.) each row should be assigned a grouping string.
